Testing ... 1, 2, 3! Hello friend!

<!--more-->
So, after years coding and doing geeky stuff I finally built myself something to share ideas with you. I am super lazy and a great procrastinator so don't expect this to get updated often.  
Since I like the web technologies, hardware, making things pretty and performant you will probably find any combination of those keywords like me trying to control some harware with web technologies, something I add to my home set-up, a random web component and what not... Stay tuned for the next update, hoping it will be a queterly one at least. ðŸ˜…

Oh and I'll probably make a lot of typos and gramatical mistakes, feel free to suggest a change.

It's always exciting to build a new computer isn't it?

<!--more-->
For several years I was more of a nomad, carrying around no more than a 13 inch laptop _(compuberto)_ that I've replaced a couple of times due to misuse, _compuberto primero_ had an invasive surgery to remove a tumor that was causing issues but after that it never was the same again and _segundo_ which turned out not to like german beer, what a dissapointment ðŸ˜ž. At home the closest thing to a desktop I've had is a raspberry Pi that is not even connected to a monitor and I use it as my Wi-Fi router, first a model A and later a model 3B+, I love those computers but can quickly reach their limits.

## What I need
So what kind of computer should I get? Before I start throwing money like crazy let's review some requirements.

### Open source friendliness
This one is easy to fulfill, I use Linux. period. I use it for more than 10 years, I don't tattoo Tux in my arm just because I don't like needles ðŸ˜‚. Linux runs basically everywhere but since _compuberto primero_ around 7 years ago I have been a happy Arch Linux user, this means going with the standard **x86-64** architecture like any modern PC.
### Host services
As a developer I create and use programs that should be running all the time, eventually it could be many services so that means **CPU** with multiple cores and enough **memory**, also lower power consumption is a plus.
### Compile code
Many of the things I create or use will need to be translated to machine code, not only work related things but also day to day tools. Since I'm no stranger to compilation and it's a task that is heavily bound to **CPU** I'll add some points there.
### Process data
Some of the things I do require processing large amounts of data, like geographical data, the faster the **CPU** is the quicker the task will run, also with more **memory** more bits of data a program can handle at a time. For machine learning models a powerful **GPU** becomes a requirement but until I really start doing anything interesting I can ignore that requirement.
### (No) Gaming
My PC gaming days are long gone so no need for fancy graphics card, actually I don't even need a monitor since a terminal or eventually a remote desktop solution would be enough.
### Store all the things
One of my goals is to use less cloud services and be "the owner of my life" as much as possible(code, photos, music ...), this means I need some **decent storage** but for starters it doesn't need to be that big since my life is not so interesting at the moment and I still can afford losing some information.
### Extendability
The amount of things that I will run in the beggining will be limited but over time I will want to run more services and more complex tasks, that's why it's important that I can easily extend the computer's capabilities.
### Misc
I don't really need a case, actually no case is a plus because I like peeking at the hardware and easilly swap components, a small footprint is desirable and no LED crazyness is also better, I don't wan't flashy lights to annoy me in the dark.

## What I got
